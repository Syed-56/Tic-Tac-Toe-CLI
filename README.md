## 1. Tic Tac Toe (PF)  
A CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, featuring colors and animations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal. It includes a professional loading screen with a spinner animation and colorful text. The game board, implemented as a 2D array, is displayed with a clear grid where Player 1's moves appear in red, Player 2's in blue, and unoccupied cells in white. The game has functions to check for ties, wins (evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals), and validate moves. The main function manages the game loop, checks the game status, and allows players to replay. A "Thank You" message concludes the session.
