A collection of my university-related projects
List of my University Projects:-
-) Tic Tac Toe (PF)
-) Course's Website (ICT)

1) Tic Tac Toe
   We created a CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, featuring colors and animations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal. A loading screen function displayed a spinner animation with colorful text, adding a professional touch. The board, implemented as a 2D array, was initialized with numbers 1 to 9 and displayed with a clear grid. Player 1's moves appeared in red, Player 2's in blue, and unoccupied cells in white. The game included functions to check for ties, wins (by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals), and validate player moves. The main function managed the game loop, alternating turns, checking game status, and displaying results. Players could replay the game after each round, and a "Thank You" message concluded the session.

2) ICT Website
   This project involves developing an ICT website designed to be a user-friendly platform for teachers and students. The website serves as a centralized hub for listing the importance of Information and Communication Technology, and why there is a need for ICT along with features for assistance of students: Class schedules, lab manuals, class tasks, exam-related information, and other educational resources. It is structured to enhance efficiency in ICT-related courses.
